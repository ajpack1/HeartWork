IMPORTANT - The code that I wrote is under a folder called Ari Work - one element of the code I added is user control - feel free to change the speed (how quickly the spheres move), the sphere count (how many spheres make up the heart with ~20 being good for a very basic heart) and shape size (how big you want the shape to appear)
